# Forex Trade Alerter
#
# This script automates the monitoring of the two trading opportunities
# identified in your "Forex Volatility Trade Optimization" document.
#
# It checks for two primary conditions:
#   1. A price breakout for USD/CAD above the specified resistance level.
#   2. The time of the Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision for GBP/USD.
#
# When a condition is met, it sends a push notification to your phone.
#

# --- SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ---
#
# 1. Install necessary Python libraries:
#    pip install requests yfinance pandas
#
# 2. Install the ntfy app on your phone (available on iOS and Android):
#    - Website: https://ntfy.sh/
#    - Once installed, "subscribe" to a topic. This can be any name you want,
#      but make it unique and hard to guess (e.g., "my-fx-alerts-Abc123").
#
# 3. Update the CONFIG section below:
#    - Set the `NTFY_TOPIC` variable to the topic name you subscribed to.
#    - Verify the trade parameters are correct.
#
# 4. Run the script from your terminal:
#    python your_script_name.py
#
# The script will then run continuously, checking prices every minute.
